# This subnet is for the IPs of the Azure App Service instances.
# For App Service instances to be able to access things in the VNet,
# we create this subnet and make use of "Virtual network integration".
#
# "Virtual network integration depends on a dedicated subnet.
# When you create a subnet, the Azure subnet loses five IPs
# from the start. One address is used from the integration
# subnet for each plan instance. If you scale your app to four
# instances, then four addresses are used.""
#
# The max scale for Azure App Service
# Default: 10
# Isolated tier (max?): 100
# So we need 105
# But when scaling, max is doubled.... so 210
# CIDR minus 5, halved and floored
# /28 16 - 5 = 11 => 5
# /27 32 - 5 = 27 => 13
# /26 64 - 5 = 59 => 29
# /25 128 - 5 = 123 => 61
# /24 256 - 5 = 251 => 125
# Ideally, Massdriver picks an IP range that is not in use
# and is a /24 so we can handle max scale of App Service.
